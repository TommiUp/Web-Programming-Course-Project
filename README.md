# Web-Programming-Course-Project

This document describes the development of a web application that visualizes Finnish municipality data using interactive maps and charts. The responsive interface allows users to explore datasets, switch between charts, and generate combined data visualizations. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet for maps, and Frappe Charts for visualization.
